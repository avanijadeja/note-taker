Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes.

# Description

In Note Taker application, User can write and save notes so they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks which they need to complete.So in this Application When user open Main page is display, when User click on Get started button user can see new page in which in page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column.When User enter a new note title and note's text then a save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.So when user click on save icon then new note is saved in and appear on left hand column with existing notes.When user clicked on an existing note in the list in the left hand column then that note appears in the right hand column.When user click on the write icon in the navigation at the top of the page then user have new empty fields to enter a new note title and note's text in th right hand column.

In this application, I first clone the starter code and then make my own repository with the starter code. In this application db folder have db.json file which used to store and retrieve notes using fs modules. so through lib folder notes.js file I done file operation like create,delete,update and read using different methods.In public folder index.html file shows main page html file and notes.html files shows second page in which user can create, update, delete and read notes operation can do.also in assets i can save screenshots in images folder, in css folder style.css file. and in js folder i saved index.js file.Main part of this application is to set a route is in routes folder. so in apiRoutes index.js file shows notesRoutes route in which get, post, delete method used to perform related operation for notes.here I used UUID to generate random number for particular note when new note is created new random Id is generated by uuid.Also in htmlRoutes I stored routes between html files.and in server.js file specify port and routes for this application. Here in port I write process.env.PORT because This application is deployed by heroku.

In this application, I used express js,node js, UUID, javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.So I can learn how to connect different html pages and how to provide random id number for every note and how to set routes between pages.So now I can improve my knowledge in front hand and also in back hand through this application I also learnt how to connect frontend part of application to backhand.Also I can test this application in postman so through postman I also learned how to do testing before deploy the application.In postman I pass particular get, post and delete method and check for particular id how to delete or update data.Also I deploy this application on heroku platform first time so I learned how to deploy application on HEROKU.
